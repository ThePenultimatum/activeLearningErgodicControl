# Ergodicity, Ergodic Control, and Fisher Information-Based Control with Infotaxis

## Overview
The code directory here contains files which calculate the ergodic metric and perform infotaxis in a stated and well-defined circumstance for simulation. Each of the files can be run directly in Matlab and then outputs resultant data and plots for simulation results.

### Ergodicity

### Infotaxis

## Results
Sample output for both ergodic control and infotaxis can be found in the imgs directory.
